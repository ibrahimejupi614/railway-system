                The team of Railway Albania consists of many different persons who are all connected by their love of travelling by train. We are frequently travelling by train which gives us lots of experience and insight that we love to share with you. The website was founded by me in 2021 with the aim of helping out fellow Interrail travellers. A few years ago People joined and a lot of information about rail travel in general was added to Railway Albania. Besides me, a diverse team helps out in different areas: from server administration and programming to content management.

                We offer thorough and free information about travelling by train. You will find tips for purchasing the best train tickets, travelling beautiful railway lines and exploring interesting cities and landscapes. We sell train tickets and we know where to find the best offers for your trip and forward you to the right place to buy your ticket. For that purpose we often use affiliate links: if you use these links to book your ticket we get a small commission - there are no extra costs for you. Of course we also help you with getting tickets where we don't get commission.
